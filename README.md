What is the latest Guardian Headline
====================================

I wrote whatisthelatestguardianheadline.com on GoogleAppEngine which involved a
bit of backend code to do various bits and bobs. This is a re-implementation
using just javascript as a test of GitHub hosted pages. The GitHub hosted
version can be found at...

I was also testing the Cloud9 IDE, I created an empty shell of a project here
on GitHub and then pulled it over to Cloud9 where all the editing took place.

Cloud9 seems a bit of an odd way of doing things and I'll write up my feelings
about it soon. Anyway, if it's something that can be forked/cloned and/or viewed
on Cloud9 then you'd possibly do that here and here...

TODO
----

* Trap errors coming back from the Guardian API
* Fully reload the page (with a metatag) once an hour anyway incase the js breaks
* Put some code in to improve the display on iPhone/iPad and mobile devices
* Add a "Fork me with GitHub" ribbon thing
* Add an about tab that links to here
* Add the abilty for a user to drop in a GuardianAPI key (that'll be stored in a cookie) just to practice doing it
